The SRC folder contains the code used to develop the spatial products featured in our webapp. The DATA folder contains the folder structure where these products are built upon. Here, you will find the following folder:
- admin: contains the administrative units of Thailand
- raster: contains the raster data used in the study
- samples: contains samples on wells collected from OSM
- waterpoints: Contains the output of our algorithm as well as a variables.csv file, which specifies which data products to use in our scoring model, as well as the weights given to each variable (NOTE: this file can be updated, reducing the demand for extensive code updates)
