# Introduction

To get an estimation, based on the environmental variables we have gathered, where there is most likely a groundwater body, we scale and center all data to make them comparable.
Then we define at which end of the distribution the most and the least suitable values are.

```{r, load packages}
root <- "/home/se87kuhe/Nextcloud/geohack19"
```

```{r, load packages}
library(raster)
library(sf)
library(readr)
library(magritts)
library(tibble)
```


```{r, scale rasters}
rasters <- list.files(path = paste0(root, "/data/raster"))

for(i in seq_along(rasters)){
  
  theRaster <- paste0(root, "/data/raster/", rasters[i])
  
  temp <- scale(raster(theRaster))
  
  writeRaster(x = temp, filename = paste0(root, "/data/raster/scaled_", rasters[i], ""), options=c("COMPRESS=LZW"))

}
```
