## GEO Hackaton 2019 Challenge 6: Detecting Ground Water Point Bore Wells

### Description
Welcome to our gitLab project! It compiles the contribution of the <a href="https://www.idiv.de/en">German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv)</a> to <a href="https://www.earthobservations.org/geoweek19.php?t=hackathon_about">the GEO Week 2019 Hackaton</a> where we spent two (very intensive) days developing a web application to inform on potentiatly suitable locations to install bores in Thailand.

### Background
<p align="justify">
"Main problems we considering are ground water. Intensive use of groundwater for irrigation leads to the lowering of water tables, reducing its potential for future use. It also generates multiple negative externalities, including salinity, stream depletion, or land subsidence that directly affect agricultural productivity, water users and the environment. So, what we are doing was detecting precise ground water points for installing bore wells. This leads to precision agriculture and also it helps in not wasting resources. On the other hand, we are arranging a mini weather station which helps in detecting Temperature, humidity, soil moisture and pm values in advance. This will help in effective use of water and pm values will help in detecting the density in crop. Main users for our project are farmers and our project will help farmers. By solving these issues, we can create huge impact on agriculture development in future, because these issues lead the farmer contact directly with producer without any expert interference in the fields."

### Process
<p align="justify">
We used a multi-variate scoring model to generate a layer that highlights potential groundwater deposits using state-of-the-art, multi-temporal, fine-resolution environmental metrics derived with a variety of satellite sensors. Nowadays, open-access satellite sensors are abundant and the development of high-performance computing platforms has lead to an era of intensive data production. In this context, the challenge of the remote sensing community is shiftting from the development of new metrics to the ability to integrate an insane multitude of data products into a meaningful - and useful - representation of the world. Following this premise, we chose to integrate different products on biophysical and socio-economic variables to detect growndwater deposits that can be used to install bores. However, their detection is not merely a biophysical process. When accessing underground aquifers, elements such as polution created by densely populated areas needs to be taken into account, since they can easily contaminate the water deposits.

### Future developments
* Direct access to satellite analysis-ready data services (e.g. GSKY, Google Earth Engine) for a timely update of our service integrating user-adjusted data
* Inclusion of machine-/deep-learning technologies to refine the selection of potential groundwater
* Delivery of time-series on climate conditions associated to the potential groundwater sites detected by our algorithm to inform on wet/dry conditions
* Relate information on e.g. atmospheric polution provided through the Copernicus Atmosphere API to identify potentially contaminated aquifers
* Allow users to provide their own information on e.g. temperature / humidity / soil moisture from mini weather stations as a modeling co-variate
